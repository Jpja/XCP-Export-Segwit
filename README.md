# Export Counterparty Addresses & Keys

Outputs a list of addresses (legacy and segwit) with private keys.

The output format is CSV for easy import to wallet, e.g. to Electrum, or spreadsheet.

The input passphrase (seed) must be a classic 12-word passphrase from Counterwallet, FreeWallet.io, Rare Pepe Wallet, IndieSquare, Freeport, Countertools, Vanilla Wallet, etc.

A BIP39 seed will not work!

Both Bitcoin mainnet and testnet are supported.

## How To Use

Download zip, extract files, and open `index.html` in a browser.

An offline computer is recommended since private keys are exposed.
